<p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice that is combined with various ingredients such as raw fish, seafood, vegetables, and egg. The most common type of sushi is called "Nigiri sushi", which is a small ball of sushi rice with a piece of raw fish or seafood on top. Another popular type of sushi is "Maki sushi", which is sushi rice and fillings wrapped in seaweed. Sushi is often served with soy sauce and wasabi for dipping, and pickled ginger (gari) to cleanse the palate between different sushi. Sushi can also be enjoyed in many different varieties like sushi roll, hand roll, and other sushi platters.</p>

<p>Salmon caviar, also known as salmon roe, is popularly used in sushi because of its unique flavor and texture. It has a delicate, slightly salty taste and a crisp, popping texture that adds a burst of flavor and texture to sushi rolls. Additionally, salmon caviar is a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients, making it a healthy addition to sushi rolls.</p>

<p>Spicy mayonnaise is a condiment commonly used in sushi dishes, especially in spicy rolls. It is made by mixing mayonnaise with chili sauce or chili paste, adding a creamy and spicy flavor to the sushi. The combination of the creamy mayonnaise with the spicy kick from the chili sauce enhances the overall taste of the sushi and provides a unique contrast of flavors.</p>
