<p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that typically consists of vinegared rice that is combined with various ingredients such as raw fish, seafood, vegetables, and egg. The most common type of sushi is called "Nigiri sushi", which is a small ball of sushi rice with a piece of raw fish or seafood on top. Another popular type of sushi is "Maki sushi", which is sushi rice and fillings wrapped in seaweed. Sushi is often served with soy sauce and wasabi for dipping, and pickled ginger (gari) to cleanse the palate between different sushi. Sushi can also be enjoyed in many different varieties like sushi roll, hand roll, and other sushi platters.</p>
