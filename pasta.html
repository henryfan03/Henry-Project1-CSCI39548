<p>Vodka sauce pasta is a popular dish that typically consists of pasta (such as penne or rigatoni) coated in a creamy tomato-based sauce that has been infused with vodka. The sauce is typically made by saut√©ing onions and garlic in butter or oil, then adding crushed tomatoes, cream, and vodka. The sauce is simmered until thickened, then tossed with cooked pasta and often garnished with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil. Vodka sauce pasta is a rich and flavorful dish that is often served as a main course.</img>
